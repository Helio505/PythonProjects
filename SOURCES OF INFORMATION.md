# Sources to learn
## tkinter/python

[Python GUI's with TKinter - Codemy](https://www.gog.com/)
This course is amazing, you learn a lot about tkinter and also python, by using it on tkinter.

## python
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)
This is very good for learning things about python. It is a lot more efficient than looking directly at the documentation. It has the theoretical part, a lot of examples and even exercises.

# Important places to know of
[GitHub](https://github.com/)
Open source projects, tutorials, code examples, etc. It can also be used for work, cv, this kind of thing. Very important and useful.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
A place where you can make questions about coding, search for ways of doing something, and be helped in general. Sometimes people are very impatient here, so be prepared for bad treatment. The website has bad aspects, but everyone uses it and it is basically the best way of searching for a solution for your problem. It is very easy to find the solution to your problem there, specially bacause most of the time you'll already find your solution without asking, because someone already did.
