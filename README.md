# PythonProjects
Some of my python projects. (and maybe a little bit of other languages)

I'm learning Python and when I accomplish my goals with a certain project I put it here. I'm saving them here for backup reasons, and also to show people out there my code, and it may help other people learn and get interested in programming.

Things to know:
- my comments are in English.
- I'm from Brazil.
- I'm doing all of these projects on Windows 10 and python 3.9
- I'm in the process of understanding github, so strange things may happen.
- I'm creating a list of good websites/documents/YouTube channels to learn things about coding. (it is called [SOURCES OF INFORMATION](https://github.com/HelioHBR/PythonProjects/blob/main/SOURCES%20OF%20INFORMATION.md))
