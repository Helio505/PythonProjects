import random

# Dice roller
# objective: you'll run the code and python will print a random number from 1 to 9

# random_number is a variable, it can store things.
# the _ in the middle is just a way of organizing things. When you have a lot of variables it is easier.
# random.randint here you are using randint(), and you are able to do that because you imported the random library module.
random_number = random.randint(1, 9) # here you are saying randint(start here, end here), so between 1 and 9
print(random_number) # with print you are printing to the terminal, and in this case you are printing what's inside the variable random_number
# so print will print what is inside the parenthesis
