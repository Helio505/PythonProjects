Here are projects for people really just starting, they don't involve complicated things.
The libraries here will be the most basic ones, not unknown or complicated.
I'll comment everything I can to make it easier.

Some things for begginers to remember:
- Anything in a python script that starts with #, is a comment and will be ignored by
everything. Comments are really important to learn, you should code as if you had to
show to someone later, in this way you explain important things to yourself.
- One little wrong piece of code will make the code break, so when copying type the code carefully.
- You should probably be using an IDE.
- (no cm) means no comments, so the code that has this has much less comments.
